# Tech Design — M1 E5 I1 Getting Started

## Objective
Create `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` as canonical onboarding for humans and AI agents.

## Contents
- Preflight checklist with exact versions
- One-true setup: init SDKs, build, test
- Run flows: spawn/attach on fixtures; expected outputs; summarize
- Troubleshooting pointers; deterministic smoke tests
- Machine interface notes (CLI flags, exit codes, optional --json example)
