# M1_E1_I1: Shared Memory Setup

## Summary
This iteration established the foundation for shared memory communication between the tracer and native agent. All planned tasks have been successfully completed.

## Lessons Learned
- Early interface validation prevented FFI issues
- Atomic operations require careful alignment
- Shared memory permissions need platform-specific handling

## Dependencies Resolved
- Frida SDK integration completed
- Platform-specific memory mapping resolved
- Cross-compilation toolchain configured

## Next Iteration
Proceed to M1_E1_I2: Thread Registry implementation
