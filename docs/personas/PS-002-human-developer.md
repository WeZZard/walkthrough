# Human Developer

## Goals

- Deploy and supervise the AI Agent effectively
- Understand and verify the agent's conclusions and findings
- Use debugger output for manual investigation when needed
- Quickly set up and configure debugging environment
- Maintain control over security-impacting actions
- Combine strategic insight with agent's tactical analysis

## Pain Points

- Needs human-readable summaries and clear visualizations
- Requires quick setup without complex configuration
- Must understand when platform limitations prevent tracing
- Needs control over security-sensitive operations
- Wants to organize debugging artifacts systematically
- May need to investigate issues the agent missed

## Behaviors

- Supervises and verifies agent work rather than doing all analysis manually
- Prefers simple commands and clear explanations
- Values explicit consent prompts for security-impacting changes
- Organizes debugging sessions and artifacts systematically
- Intervenes when agent analysis is incomplete
- Hands off tactical analysis to agent after setting up strategic context
- Uses intermittent sessions for oversight and verification
