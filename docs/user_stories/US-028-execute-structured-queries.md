# Execute structured queries against trace

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** execute a series of structured queries against the trace after receiving a symptom description from a human
**So that** I can gather evidence related to my hypothesis about the bug

## Acceptance Criteria

- Query API supports structured query syntax
- Multiple queries can be executed in sequence
- Query results are returned in machine-readable format
- Queries can be filtered by function, time, or event type
