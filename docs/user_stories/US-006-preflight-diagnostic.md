# Run preflight diagnostic

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** run a preflight diagnostic against a target
**So that** I can determine if tracing is possible and obtain a machine-readable remediation plan when it is not

## Acceptance Criteria

- Diagnostic checks all tracing prerequisites
- Results are returned in machine-readable format
- Remediation plan includes specific actionable steps
- Diagnostic completes quickly without requiring actual tracing
