# Explicit consent for security changes

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** have explicit consent prompts before any code-signing or entitlement changes are suggested
**So that** I can control security-impacting actions

## Acceptance Criteria

- No automatic security-related modifications
- Clear prompts before suggesting security changes
- User can approve or decline each suggestion
- Security implications are explained clearly
