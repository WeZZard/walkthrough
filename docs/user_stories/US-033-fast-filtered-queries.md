# Fast random-access filtered queries

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** perform fast, random-access, and filtered queries (e.g., by function name or event type)
**So that** I can efficiently navigate trace data to find specific evidence

## Acceptance Criteria

- Query response time is subsecond for typical traces
- Random access to any trace position is supported
- Filters by function name, event type, time range work
- Query API is machine-readable and consistent
