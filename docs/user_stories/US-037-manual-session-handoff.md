# Manual session with agent handoff

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** initiate a new debugging session in a manual mode, set up a specific context that I believe the agent missed, and then hand control to the agent
**So that** I can combine my own strategic insight with the agent's high-speed tactical analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

- Manual debugging session can be initiated
- Context setup is possible before agent handoff
- Handoff to agent is explicit and controlled
- Agent continues from established context
