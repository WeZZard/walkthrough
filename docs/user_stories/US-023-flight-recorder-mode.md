# Flight-recorder mode with triggers

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** enable a flight-recorder mode with a time-bounded detailed window (pre/post roll) and arm triggers from the CLI
**So that** I can capture rich context around suspicious moments without drowning in data

## Acceptance Criteria

- Flight-recorder mode can be enabled from CLI
- Pre/post roll windows are configurable
- Triggers can be armed via command-line options
- Trace size remains manageable
