# Inspect variables and registers when paused

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** inspect the values of variables and CPU registers when a live execution is paused
**So that** I can understand the program's state at a specific moment

## Acceptance Criteria

- Local and global variables can be inspected
- CPU register values are accessible
- Values are returned in machine-readable format
- Type information is included with values
