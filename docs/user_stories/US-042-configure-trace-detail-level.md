# Configure trace detail level

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** configure the level of detail captured in traces (minimal/standard/verbose)
**So that** I can balance trace size with information richness

## Acceptance Criteria

- Detail level can be specified at trace start
- Different levels produce predictable trace sizes
- Detail level affects captured events and data
- Level can be changed for subsequent traces
