# Interactive search of completed trace

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** use a fast, interactive search interface to manually query a completed trace history
**So that** I can conduct my own investigation to find evidence the agent may have missed

## Acceptance Criteria

- Search interface is responsive and fast
- Full-text and filtered search are supported
- Results are displayed with context
- Navigation between results is intuitive
