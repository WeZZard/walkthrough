# Programmatically start program with tracing

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** programmatically start a program with tracing enabled
**So that** I can begin a debugging session on demand

## Acceptance Criteria

- API provides program launch with trace capability
- Launch request is machine-readable and structured
- Trace begins immediately on program start
- Launch failures are reported with clear error codes
