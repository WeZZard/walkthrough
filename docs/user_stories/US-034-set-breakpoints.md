# Set breakpoints at functions or lines

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** set breakpoints at specific functions or source code lines

## Acceptance Criteria

- Breakpoints can be set by function name or address
- Source line breakpoints are supported
- Breakpoint setting is confirmed via API response
- Multiple breakpoints can be active simultaneously
