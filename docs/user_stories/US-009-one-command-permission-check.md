**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** use a one-command check that clearly explains what permissions or settings are missing
**So that** I can quickly bring my machine to a trace-ready state

## Acceptance Criteria

- Single command checks all permission requirements
- Output clearly lists missing permissions
- Instructions for fixing each issue are provided
- Check completes quickly without modifying system
