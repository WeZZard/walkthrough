# View tracer impact metrics

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** see tracer impact metrics (overhead %, ring utilization, sustained write rate) during/after a run
**So that** I can judge whether tracing perturbed program timing

## Acceptance Criteria

- Overhead percentage is calculated and displayed
- Ring buffer utilization is tracked
- Write rate statistics are provided
- Metrics are available during and after execution
