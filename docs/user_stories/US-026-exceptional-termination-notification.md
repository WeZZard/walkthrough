# Exceptional termination notification

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** be notified of an exceptional termination (e.g., a crash) in the initial trace summary
**So that** I can autonomously begin my investigation at the point of failure

## Acceptance Criteria

- Trace summary includes termination status
- Crash information is provided in machine-readable format
- Signal/exception type is identified
- Crash location is included when available
