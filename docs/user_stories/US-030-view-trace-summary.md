# View high-level trace summary

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** see the same high-level summary the AI Agent sees (e.g., termination status)
**So that** I can be on the same page as the agent from the start

## Acceptance Criteria

- Summary is human-readable and well-formatted
- Termination status is clearly displayed
- Summary includes key trace metadata
- Summary is generated automatically after trace completion

## References

- Persona: PS-002 (Human Developer)
