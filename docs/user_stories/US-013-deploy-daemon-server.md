# Deploy local daemon server

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** deploy a local daemon server with full tracing permissions
**So that** I can connect remotely and trace binaries through the daemon as if I were using the system locally

## Acceptance Criteria

- Daemon can be deployed with single command
- Daemon runs with appropriate tracing permissions
- Remote connections are authenticated and secure
- Daemon operates transparently for tracing operations
