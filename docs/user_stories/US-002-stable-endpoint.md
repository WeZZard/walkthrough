# Connect to stable debugger endpoint

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** have a clear and stable endpoint (e.g., a TCP port or a Unix socket) to connect to the debugger service
**So that** I can initiate a communication session

## Acceptance Criteria

- Endpoint address is well-defined and documented
- Connection protocol is stable across versions
- Endpoint is discoverable programmatically
- Connection handshake is machine-readable
