# Deterministic error-to-action mapping

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** have deterministic error-to-action mapping for common failures (e.g., Developer Tools permission missing, sudo required, code-signing/library validation issues, protected processes)
**So that** I can guide the user with exact next steps

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each error type maps to specific remediation actions
- Error codes and messages are consistent
- Remediation steps are actionable and complete
- Common platform-specific failures are covered
