# Automatically load debug symbols

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** have the debugger automatically find and load the debug symbols for my program
**So that** I don't have to configure symbol paths manually

## Acceptance Criteria

- Debug symbols are discovered automatically from standard locations
- Symbol loading happens without manual configuration
- Missing symbols are reported clearly
- Symbol paths can be overridden if needed
