# Freely manage breakpoints in manual session

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** freely add, remove, and modify my own breakpoints and watchpoints during a manual session
**So that** I have complete control over the debugging setup, independent of the agent's prior configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

- Breakpoints can be added at any time during session
- Existing breakpoints can be modified or removed
- Watchpoints have same management capabilities
- Changes take effect immediately
