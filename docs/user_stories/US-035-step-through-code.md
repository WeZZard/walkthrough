# Step through code line-by-line

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** step through code line-by-line (step over, step into, step out)
**So that** I can observe a live program's behavior in fine detail

## Acceptance Criteria

- Step over, step into, step out commands are available
- Stepping respects source line boundaries
- Current position is reported after each step
- Stepping works across function boundaries
