# Clear explanations for system binary limitations

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** see clear, user-friendly explanations when system binaries cannot be traced
**So that** I understand this is a platform security feature, not a bug in the tool

## Acceptance Criteria

- Error messages explain platform security rationale
- Guidance distinguishes tool issues from platform restrictions
- Explanations are non-technical and user-friendly
- Alternative approaches are suggested when available
