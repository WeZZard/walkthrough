# Attach to running process

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** attach the tracer to an already running process
**So that** I can debug issues without restarting the application

## Acceptance Criteria

- Process can be identified by PID or name
- Attachment succeeds for traceable processes
- Trace begins immediately upon attachment
- Attachment failures provide clear error messages
