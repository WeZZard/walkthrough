# Inspect trace file metadata

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** inspect trace file metadata (format version, timestamps, target info)
**So that** I can validate the trace before beginning analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

- Metadata is accessible via API
- Format version is clearly identified
- Timestamps include trace start/end times
- Target executable and platform info included
