# Platform security restriction notification

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** be informed when a binary cannot be traced due to platform security restrictions
**So that** I can take the appropriate platform-specific actions to enable tracing

## Acceptance Criteria

- Notification identifies specific platform restriction
- Platform-specific remediation steps are provided
- Links to relevant platform documentation included
- Notification appears before trace attempt fails
