# Select key symbols for focused capture

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** select "key symbols" using function IDs and update them live for focused detailed capture
**So that** detail capture focuses on relevant functions while the rest of the run retains a compact index

## Acceptance Criteria

- Key symbols can be selected by function ID
- Selection can be updated during trace execution
- Detailed capture applies only to selected symbols
- Non-key symbols maintain lightweight indexing
