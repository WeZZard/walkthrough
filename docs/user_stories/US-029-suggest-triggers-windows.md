# Suggest triggers and windows from analysis

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** have the query engine suggest triggers and windows (functions, thresholds, pre/post roll) based on an index-only run and symptom text
**So that** I can configure a focused follow-up capture automatically

## Acceptance Criteria

- Analysis generates trigger suggestions
- Suggestions include specific functions and thresholds
- Pre/post roll recommendations are provided
- Suggestions are based on initial index trace
