# Query debugger capabilities and API schema

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** query the debugger for its capabilities and the API schema it supports
**So that** I can understand how to interact with it effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

- Debugger exposes a machine-readable API schema
- Schema includes all available endpoints and operations
- Capability information is returned in structured format
- Schema is version-stable and well-documented
