# Review agent's breakpoints and watchpoints

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** review the breakpoints and watchpoints the agent used when starting a manual session after a failed agent attempt
**So that** I can decide whether to reuse, modify, or discard them for my own investigation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Agent's breakpoints are listed and accessible
- Watchpoints are included in the review
- Each breakpoint shows location and condition
- Breakpoints can be enabled/disabled/removed
