# Trace completion notification with file path

**As an** AI Agent
**I want to** be notified when the trace is complete and receive a path to the resulting trace file
**So that** I can proceed with the analysis phase

## Acceptance Criteria

- Notification indicates trace completion status
- Trace file path is provided in machine-readable format
- Notification includes basic trace metadata
- Failure to write trace file is reported clearly
