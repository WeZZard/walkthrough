# Describe buggy behavior in natural language

**As a** Human Developer
**I want to** describe the buggy behavior I observed in natural language after reviewing the initial summary for a non-crashing run
**So that** I can provide the AI Agent with the starting point for its investigation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Natural language input is accepted
- Input mechanism is user-friendly (CLI or interactive)
- Description is passed to agent analysis workflow
- No specific format is required
