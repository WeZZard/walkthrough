# ADA - AI Agent Debugging Architecture

A high-performance tracing system designed for debugging AI agents with minimal overhead and token-budget-aware analysis.

## Quick Start

See [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for setup instructions.

## Project Overview

ADA provides a dual-lane flight recorder architecture for tracing AI agent execution:
- **Index Lane**: Always-on lightweight event capture
- **Detail Lane**: Selective persistence of rich debugging data
- **Token-Budget-Aware**: Optimized for LLM context window constraints

## Core Components

- **tracer**: Rust control plane for trace management
- **tracer_backend**: High-performance C/C++ data plane
- **query_engine**: Python-based token-budget-aware analysis
- **mcp_server**: Model Context Protocol interface

## Development Workflow

### Engineering Efficiency Documentation

For human developers, comprehensive guides are available:

#### Standards & Requirements

- [Engineering Standards](docs/technical_insights/engineering_process/ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md)
- [Quality Gate Implementation](docs/technical_insights/engineering_process/QUALITY_GATE_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- [Coverage System Analysis](docs/technical_insights/engineering_process/COVERAGE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md)

### For AI Agents

When using Claude Code or other AI assistants, agents will be spawned automatically based on the task. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for AI-specific instructions.

## Build System

**Cargo orchestrates everything:**

```bash
cargo build --release    # Build all components
cargo test --all        # Run all tests
./utils/run_coverage.sh # Generate coverage reports
```

## Quality Requirements

- **Build Success**: 100% (all components must build)
- **Test Success**: 100% (all tests must pass)
- **Coverage**: 100% on changed lines
- **Integration Score**: 100/100

## Platform Requirements

### macOS
- Apple Developer Certificate ($99/year) required for tracing
- See [Platform Security Requirements](docs/specs/PLATFORM_SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md)

### Linux
- May require ptrace capabilities
- See platform-specific setup in Getting Started guide
